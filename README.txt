Steps taken by code

1- connect to localhost (specify IP if YB not present locally)
2- loads secret.json file for google sheets (create service account if you dont have or ask adithya or guru for json)
3- creates the dataframs needed for tables (account, live, history)
4- inserts df to the tables


What is missing
1- History table pseudo code is there but not added. Need to clarify some doubts.
2- Delete function is part of main code. Need to create a new script for it.
